# Intereset of content
Sections are fairly small and the information is condensed hence it was interesting to read, if the user wants to learn more they are provided with hyperlinks to the pages with more information.

# Consistency and quality of presentation
The webpages are linked to the same Bootstrap file hence the design is somewhat consistent between pages in terms of image sizing and fonts, however some pages have their own margin values different to other so some pages have less white space than others. The card-body div is present on all of the pages which looks really nice and fitting.

# Quality of written presentation
Styling is good, a lot of white space, not too much information to overload the reader, pages include images and colours which make the reading experience good.

# Validity of HTML
HTML files are structured consistently with the divs and other tags and are easy to read and make changes.

# Evidence of collaboration
All collaborators have done many commits, including pushing changes to the website of other collaborators like the "Authored by" box and comments.
